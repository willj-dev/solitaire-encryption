# solitaire-encryption

Implements the [Solitaire encryption algorithm](https://www.schneier.com/academic/solitaire/) by Bruce Schneier and featured in the novel Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson.

Note that this is a completely silly thing to do, since the point of the algorithm is to be able to use it by hand with a physical deck of cards. This is just a Haskell exercise `:)`
